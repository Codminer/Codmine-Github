        Chandrasekhar was an Indian physicist who made significant contributions
        to the structure of stars and black holes.

          Here's a time line of "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar" life:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1910</strong> -19 October 1910 Lahore, Punjab, British India
            (modern Punjab, Pakistan)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1916-1918</strong> - The family moved from Lahore to
            Allahabad in 1916, and finally settled in Madras in 1918.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong> - Chandrasekhar was awarded his PhD degree at
            Cambridge in the summer of 1933, with a thesis on rotating
            self-gravitating polytrophic. He was the first Indian to be awarded
            a PhD in astrophysics.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - In 1935, Chandrasekhar was invited by the
            director of the Harvard Observatory, Harlow Shapely, to be a
            visiting lecturer in theoretical astrophysics for a three-month
            period. He traveled to the United States in December. During his
            visit to Harvard, Chandrasekhar greatly impressed Shaley, but
            declined his offer of a Harvard research fellowship. At the same
            time, Chandrasekhar met Gerard Kuiper, a noted Dutch astrophysical
            observational who was then a leading authority on white dwarfs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> -During World War II, Chandrasekhar worked at
            the Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in
            Maryland. While there, he worked on problems of ballistics, he
            expertise in hydrodynamics led Robert Oppenheimer to invite him to
            join the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, but delays in the
            processing of his security clearance prevented him from contributing
            to the project. It has been rumoured that he visited the Calutron
            project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal life</strong> - Chandrasekhar was the nephew of C.
            V. Raman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930.
            Chandrasekhar married "Lalitha Doraiswamy" in September 1936. He met
            her as a fellow student at Presidency College. He became a citizen
            of the U.S. in 1953. Many considered him as warm, positive,
            generous, unassuming, meticulous, and open to debate, while some
            others as private, intimidating, impatient and stubborn regarding
            non-scientific matters, and unforgiving to those who ridiculed his
            work. Chandrasekhar was a vegetarian. Chandrasekhar died of a heart
            attack at the University ogitf Chicago Hospital in 1995, having
            survived a prior heart attack in 1975. He was survived by his wife,
            who died on 2 September 2013 at the age of 102. She was a serious
            student of literature and western classical music.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Religious beliefs</strong> - Chandrasekhar was a Hindu by
            birth, but he did not practice any religion. He was an atheist and
            did not believe in the existence of God. He was known to be a
            rationalist and a skeptic, often questioning religious beliefs and
            practices. Once when involved in a discussion about the Bhagavad
            Gita, Chandrasekhar said: "I should like to preface my remarks with
            a personal statement in order that my later remarks will not be
            misunderstood. I consider myself an atheist".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Other activities</strong> - Chandrasekhar published his
            first paper on the stability of white dwarfs, which led to the
            discovery of the Chandrasekhar limit. This limit is the maximum mass
            (approximately 1.4 solar masses) that a white dwarf star can have
            before it collapses under its own gravity, leading to either a
            supernova or the formation of a neutron star or black hole. From
            1952 to 1971 Chandrasekhar was editor of The Astrophysical Journal.
            When Eugene Parker submitted a paper on his discovery of solar wind
            in 1957, two eminent reviewers rejected the paper. However, since
            Chandra as an editor could not find any mathematical flaws in
            Parker's work, he went ahead and published the paper in 1958. During
            the years 1990 to 1995, Chandrasekhar worked on a project devoted to
            explaining the detailed geometric arguments in Sir Isaac Newton's
            Philosophiae, Naturals, Principia, Mathematica using the language
            and methods of ordinary calculus. The effort resulted in the book
            Newton's Principia for the Common Reader, published in 1995.
            Chandrasekhar also worked on collision of gravitational waves, and
            algebraically special perturbations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - Chandrasekhar was awarded half of the Nobel
            Prize in Physics in 1983 for his studies on the physical processes
            important to the structure and evolution of stars. Chandrasekhar
            accepted this honour, but was upset the citation mentioned only his
            earliest work, seeing it as a denigration of a lifetime's
            achievement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1995</strong> - Chandrasekhar died of a heart attack at the
            University of Chicago Hospital in 1995, having survived a prior
            heart attack in 1975.
          </li>

          <p>"I have never been able to find out why I was born in India. I have
          never been able to find out why I was born in India. I have never been
          able to find out why I was born in India."
